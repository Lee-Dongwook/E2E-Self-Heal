## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CLI core (`e2e-healer`) that heals a failing Playwright test end-to-end: preprocess
  (error log + JSX/TSX diff), LangGraph loop (Diagnoser → Patch Generator → Test Runner),
  and a Router with a loop cap.
- Self-run failure capture when `--log` is omitted; `--dry-run`, `--diff-base`, `--json`.
- Atomic in-place writes with restore-on-give-up.
- Reusable composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`) + example patch-PR workflow.
- Unit and mocked end-to-end tests; repo CI (lint, format, typecheck, test).
